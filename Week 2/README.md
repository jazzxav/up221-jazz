### Hi my name is Jazz Henry and I am a first year MURP with a double concentration in **Climate, Environment, and Society** as well as **Design and Development**. I grew up in Bermuda ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡²and Jamaica ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡² and moved to Florida when I was nine. I have been in LA for the last five years!
## Course Purpose and Personal Objective
### THe prupose of this course is to prepare us for challenges with urban data by helping us develop skills to transform, analyze, express, and visualize data in unique ways. I am very passionate about sports and the environment. Through this course, I hope to develop my GIS skills further and feel comfortable using this tool to explore topics like the impact of extreme heat on sports surfaces and neighborhoods, as well as accessability to sports facilities for park-poor regions of LA. I'm really looking forward to this class and I hope everyone is enjoying the long weekend!
